    "The MDE representation consists of 3 things for every note onset in a piece:\n",
    "1. The pitch of the lowest note (a number 1-12 corresponding to A, A#, ....)\n",
    "2. The octave of the lowest note (a number 0-7 corresponding to which octave on the piano)\n",
    "3. The hand configuration (a number 0-136 that maps to a of hand configurations)\n",
    "\n",
    "To feed this information into BERT with standard huggingface components, I am using an intermediate, proxy tokenizer. At each step, the three elements are concatenated with a separation character. For example, a step with pitch 6, octave 2, and hand configuration 12 becomes 6s2s12. With this intermediate step, the sequence is dimension (1, max_seq_len) instead of (3, max_seq_len), so the default huggingface tokenizers, collators, and trainers can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the modified components, there are 3 separate embedding layers at the encoder and decoder(we effectively have three separate vocabularies). The first step in the encoder is to convert the MDE representation(ie. 6s2s12) back to a separate pitch, octave, hand representation so that it can be passed throgh three separate embedding layers.The outputs of the embedding layers can then be summed so that input to the attention layers has the normal shape (768). The decoder then has to have three separate linear layers to map the hidden state back to pitch, octave, hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make these changes in huggingface, we need to construct a custom encoder by modifying the BertEmbedding layer, and a custom decoder by modifying the BertLMPredictionHead. We also need to modify the BertForMaskedLM model itself so that the forward function expects three outputs.\n",
